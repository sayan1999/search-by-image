# Image Reverse Search Web App

## Description

### A very fast reverse image search webapp in streamlit using NVIDIA's EfficientNet and Facebook's Faiss library. 70000 images (224x224), 4GB GTX1650: FAISS GPU in 10 secs vs 30 mins with Annoy CPU

Upload a picture, and AI powered by deep learning will instantly show you visually related matches. Explore and discover connections through the magic of image recognition.

## Demo

Experience the app in action right in your browser: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Instantaneous1/search-by-image

## Key Features

- Upload a query image to find visually similar images in the dataset.
- Explore retrieved images to discover related content.
- Adjust the number of matches displayed for visual comparisons.
- Utilizes a pre-trained image feature extractor model (EfficientNet-b0) for accurate image similarity.
- Employs FAISS index for fast approximate nearest neighbor search.
- Offers a user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone [git@github.com:sayan1999/search-by-image.git](git@github.com:sayan1999/search-by-image.git)
```

2. Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Streamlit app:

for quickly dl embeddings and skipp training

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

or

to rebuild embeddings

```bash
streamlit run app.py -- --dev
```

4. Access the app in your web browser (usually at http://localhost:8501).

## Technology Stack

Streamlit: Framework for building and deploying web apps in Python.
Torch: Powerful deep learning framework.
OpenDatasets: Library for convenient dataset downloading.
FAISS: Facebook's fast AI vector similarity search
NVIDIA EfficientNet-b0: Pre-trained image classification model for feature extraction.
